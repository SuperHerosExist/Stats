## ‚úÖ Completed So Far

1. ‚úÖ Firebase CLI installed globally
2. ‚úÖ Firebase project initialized (`bowlingstatstracker`)
3. ‚úÖ Firestore database created
4. ‚úÖ Security rules deployed
5. ‚úÖ Firebase configuration files created

## üéØ What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Copy Bowling App Files

The complete bowling app is in `bowling-app/` subdirectory. You need to copy its contents to integrate with your Firebase setup:

```bash
# In the WHS directory
cd bowling-app
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Firebase Credentials

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bowlingstatstracker/settings/general)
2. Scroll to "Your apps" section
3. Click "Add app" ‚Üí Web (</>) icon
4. Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "Bowling Stats Web App")
5. Copy the Firebase configuration

### Step 3: Create Environment File

Create `bowling-app/.env` file with your Firebase config:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=bowlingstatstracker.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=bowlingstatstracker
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=bowlingstatstracker.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Step 4: Enable Authentication in Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bowlingstatstracker/authentication)
2. Click "Get Started"
3. Enable **Email/Password** sign-in method
4. Enable **Google** sign-in method
   - Add your email as a test user if needed

### Step 5: Test the App Locally

```bash
cd bowling-app
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` and:
1. Try signing up with an email/password
2. Try signing in with Google
3. Explore the dashboard

### Step 6: Create Your First Coach Account

After signing up:
1. Go to [Firestore Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bowlingstatstracker/firestore)
2. Find the `users` collection
3. Locate your user document
4. Edit the document and change `role` from `"player"` to `"coach"`

### Step 7: Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Optional)

```bash
# In the WHS directory (not bowling-app)
firebase init hosting

# Select:
# - Use existing project: bowlingstatstracker
# - Public directory: bowling-app/dist
# - Single-page app: Yes
# - Set up automatic builds: No

# Build the app
cd bowling-app
npm run build
cd ..

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Your app will be live at: `https://bowlingstatstracker.web.app`

### Step 8: Set Up Firebase Hosting (Detailed)

If you want to deploy the app:

```bash
# Initialize hosting (in WHS directory)
firebase init hosting

# When prompted:
# - What do you want to use as your public directory? bowling-app/dist
# - Configure as a single-page app? Yes
# - Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
# - File bowling-app/dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
```

Then build and deploy:
```bash
cd bowling-app && npm run build && cd ..
firebase deploy --only hosting
```
