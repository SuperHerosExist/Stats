## Technology Decisions

### Why This Stack?
- **Vite** - Fast development, modern tooling
- **React 19** - Latest features, concurrent rendering
- **TypeScript** - Type safety, better DX
- **Firebase** - Managed backend, real-time sync
- **TailwindCSS v4** - Utility-first, rapid styling
- **TanStack Query** - Server state management
- **Vitest** - Fast, ESM-native testing

### Data Model Choices
1. **Normalized Schema** - Separate collections for games, frames, balls
   - Pros: Flexible queries, scalable
   - Cons: More complex reads (mitigated by proper indexing)

2. **Ball-by-Ball Tracking** - Complete throw history
   - Enables detailed analytics
   - Supports undo functionality
   - Allows post-game analysis

3. **Baker Rotation** - Player ID per frame
   - Correctly attributes stats to thrower
   - Supports rotation visualization
   - Maintains team game integrity
